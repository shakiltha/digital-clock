## Overview
It is looks like a **timehouse**.
This is a simple **Digital Clock**. I have emphasized on *CSS* part for this project. Because There is not much *JavaScript* needed for this project. All you have to know for this project is *JS* **Date** object.

### What I have learned
- how to switch between **am** and **pm** in **js**
- **Date** object
- **inset** box shadow in css

### Difficulties
- Allignment of two lines for **stairs**

### Features
- Digital Clock, Same time as of your local machine time.
- Using *opening curly brace* has made it like a gate of *timehouse*.
- There is two pillars, there is a *linear gradient* background image in those pillars. Also there is some animation going on in the pillars.
- There is six stair to reach the gate of **timehouse**.
